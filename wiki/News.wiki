  * 2011-02-21 - First day of coding, and first commit seems pretty solid with anecdotal testing.  Use at your own risk!  The tests that came from Dumbster are broken and I haven't written any of my own yet.  First order of business though.  When building alter the maven command to this until the tests are fixed: {{{ mvn -DskipTests=true package }}}.  When I have all the tests working, I'll upload a binary build, so you can download and deploy.
